# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)

by Brendan Wakefield (2019)

### Description

This repository contains the raw data and analysis files for the Titanic
dataset taken from the Kaggle competition website. I began by following some
of the posted solutions such as [this one]() and [this one](), however I am
correcting some data processing errors along the way, as well as performing my
own data explorations.
